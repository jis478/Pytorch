# A simple implementation for Swapping-Autoencoder-for-Deep-Image Manipulation

## Overview 

This is a simple implementation for [Swapping-Autoencoder-for-Deep-Image Manipulation](https://taesung.me/SwappingAutoencoder/). This work heavily borrowed network codes from [here1](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch) and some loss functions from [here2](https://github.com/rosinality/swapping-autoencoder-pytorch). I've found some differences between this work and [here2](https://github.com/rosinality/swapping-autoencoder-pytorch) in terms of patch generation and some training details. I've tried to follow as many detail instructions on papaer as possible such as removing mini-batach statistic in Discriminator. 

## Usage
Detail instructions will be updated soon
