# A simple implementation for Swapping-Autoencoder-for-Deep-Image Manipulation (To be updated)

## Overview 

This is a simple implementation for [Swapping-Autoencoder-for-Deep-Image Manipulation](https://taesung.me/SwappingAutoencoder/). This work heavily borrowed StyleGAN V2 network codes from [here1](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch) and some util functions from [here2](https://github.com/rosinality/swapping-autoencoder-pytorch). I've found some differences between this work and [here2](https://github.com/rosinality/swapping-autoencoder-pytorch) in terms of patch generation and some training details. 

## Status
Currently training is on-going and results will be posted here soon.
