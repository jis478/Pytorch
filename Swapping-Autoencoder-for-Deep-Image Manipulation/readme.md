# A simple implementation for Swapping-Autoencoder-for-Deep-Image Manipulation (To be updated)

## Overview 

This is a simple implementation for [Swapping-Autoencoder-for-Deep-Image Manipulation](https://taesung.me/SwappingAutoencoder/). This work heavi
ly borrowed StyleGAN V2 network codes from [here](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch).

## Status
Currently training is on-going and results will be posted here soon.
